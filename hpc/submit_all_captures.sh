# submit_attack_sweep.sh handles ONE capture and CLEARS its output dirs on the way in, so calling
# it in a loop directly would leave only the last capture's cells. This clears once, then passes
# KEEP_PREVIOUS=1 to every call.
#
# ONE SWEEP COVERS BOTH MODELS: SDformerFlow (snn) and STTFlowNet-en4 (ann) share this repo's venv
# and its voxel tensors, so the per-capture submission already carries both and only the clean
# checks and the clear need to name them.
#
# SDA needs a per-capture target: the tau factor at which that capture's outcome tier changes,
# from a tau_probe record. A capture the probe never moved has no meaningful target, so it is
# SKIPPED rather than attacked against a threshold the planner does not care about. Set
# SDA_FALLBACK to attack those at a fixed factor instead.
